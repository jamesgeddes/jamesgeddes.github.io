# Interests
## Geek.Zone

I founded [Geek.Zone](http://Geek.Zone) in 2013 with the aim of connecting geeky people. Some still erroneously think
that “geek” is a pejorative term, and why should it be? After all, a geek is someone who is knowledgeable, passionate
and interested. Are these not positive qualities? Are these not the characteristics that are needed in order to improve
society and the planet?

Since 2013, Geek.Zone has

- grown to three Districts around Britain.
- touched the lives of thousands of people.
- been recognised with UK registered charity status.

Our next step is to open [Geek.Zone/01](http://geek.zone/01) in Coventry, our first 24/7 community hub.

##Motoring
Aside from technology, my interests are rather varied. They include classic motoring, ranging from my beautiful 1982
Mini HLE, up to the Routemaster, which I have had the good fortune to have a go at driving!

##Bagpipes
I also play the Great Highland Bagpipes. I do understand that this is quite a “Marmite” instrument, however they have
taken me on some great adventures, such as folk festivals across Europe and hundred-piper massed bands.

##Aviation
One of my earliest passions is certainly aviation. The mechanics and engineering that goes into every square centimetre
of an aircraft design is simply stunning. I am certainly looking forward to attaining my Private Pilots Licence!
