# Geek.Zone

I founded Geek.Zone in 2013 with the aim of connecting geeky people. Some still erroneously think that “geek” is a pejorative term, and why should it be? After all, a geek is someone who is knowledgeable, passionate and interested. Are these not positive qualities? Are these not the characteristics that are needed in order to improve society and the planet?

Since 2013, Geek.Zone has grown to three Districts around Britain and has touched the lives of thousands of people. GeekZoneCoventry is even aiming to acquire its own physical space this year!

# Interests

Aside from technology, my interests are rather varied. They include classic motoring, ranging from my beautiful 1982 Mini HLE, up to the Routemaster, which I have had the good fortune to have a go at driving!

I also play the Great Higland Bagpipes. I do understand that this is quite a “Marmite” instrument, however they have taken me on some great adventures, such as folk festivals across Europe, as well as massed bands of over a hundred members.

One of my earliest passions is certainly aviation. The mechanics and engineering that goes into every square centimetre of an aircraft design is simply stunning. I am certainly looking forward to attaining my Private Pilots Licence!

# Gifts

If you feel like doing something awesome for me for any reason - perhaps I helped you solve a problem, perhaps it's my birthday, perhaps you are just feeling like a wonderful person! I would be very grateful of a gift via any of these great places.
